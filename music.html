      <h2>More About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, I am Bea Alexis M. Capule you can call me Lex or Alex. My hobbies is playing, drawing, bicycling, eating, painting, listening to
        music, and reading and there's a lot. I used to play online games like codm, ML, valo and genshin impact these are just the online games that I often play
        but there's many more. I do paint but I just don't have canvas and painting, so I'm into drawing or sketching right now. Mostly I like grunge
        art because it is my style. also music makes me happy I can't live without music. Listening to it feels relieve and make my mood lighting up.
        Listening to music while reading are just the best combo for me it helps me relax while reading, also listening to music outside makes 
        you think real world is different from your perspective.
